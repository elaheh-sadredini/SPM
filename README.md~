# SPM

This code implements sequential pattern mining using a breadth-frist-search algorithm. 


## Usage:

`./gsp_cpu <frequency> <input file> <Dumping results (yes = 1, No = 0)> <Allow gap between itemsets (yes = 1, No = 0)>`


You can set "Allow gap between itemsets" to "0" in order to mine the consequtive frequent itemset. 



## Input format:

-1 is a delimiter between itemsets 

-2 is a delimiter betweeen sequences 

**Sample input file**

        1 2 -1 3 4 -1 -2
        5 6 -1 -2
        -2


## Performance:

GPU and multi-thread CPU implementation of the code is available. Please contact "elaheh@virginia.edu" for more information.
